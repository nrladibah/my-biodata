                            <h6>The USDA Food Guide Pyramid and MyPyramid The Food Guide Pyramid was a recognizable nutrition tool that was introduced by the USDA in 1992. It was shaped like a pyramid to suggest that a person should eat more foods from the bottom of the pyramid and fewer foods and beverages from the top of the pyramid. The Food Guide Pyramid displayed proportionality and variety in each of five groups of foods and beverages, which ascended in horizontal layers starting from the base and moving upward toward the tip: breads, cereals, pasta and rice; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; eggs, fish, legumes, meat and poultry; plus alcohol, fats and sugars. The 1992 USDA Food Guide Pyramid is shown in Figure 1-1. In 2005, the USDA introduced MyPyramid, an updated version of the Food Guide Pyramid. Food groups were depicted in ascending vertical bands that emphasized the right proportions of food groups. An image of a person walking up a flight of stairs flanked the pyramid to emphasize activity. Instead of servings, quantities were measured in cups and ounces. Other food guide pyramids followed, including the Mediterranean and Asian. Each of the ethnic food guide pyramids added, deleted, or substituted culturally correct foods with those in the USDA Food Guide Pyramid. For example, yogurt and goat milk products appeared in the Mediterranean Food Guide Pyramid, since intolerance to dairy products from cows is prevalent in this region of the world. Likewise, the Asian Food Guide Pyramid included soy products to replace the nutrients that are normally found in dairy products. Additional food guide pyramids have been developed for children, seniors, vegetarians and a number of other groups to meet their specific nutritional needs. Yet, in 2011, after six years, the USDA replaced the Food Guide Pyramid with the nutrition guide MyPlate. Food guide pyramids are still used in other parts of the world and by some specialty groups.</h6>

                    <h6>Balanced diet is a key to stay healthy. Follow the "Healthy Eating Food Pyramid" guide as you pick your food. Grains should be taken as the most. Eat more fruit and vegetables. Have a moderate amount of meat, fish, egg, milk and their alternatives. Reduce fat/ oil, salt and sugar. Trim fat from meat before cooking. Cook with low-fat methods such as steaming, stewing, simmering, boiling, scalding or cooking with non-stick frying pans. Also reduce the use of frying and deep-frying. These can help us achieve a balanced diet and promote health. How much of different kinds of food should I eat to stay healthy?</h6>
                    <h4>Eat the Right Food</h4>
                        <h6>Since different foods have different nutritional values, it is not possible to obtain all the nutrients we need from a single food. According to the Healthy Eating Food Pyramid, we have to eat a variety of foods among all food groups as well as within each group in order to get different nutrients and meet our daily needs.</h6>
                         
                    <h4>Eat the Right Amount</h4>
                        <h6>Neither eating too much nor too little is good for our health. Every day, we need a specific amount of nutrients to maintain optimal health. If we do not eat enough, malnutrition or symptoms of nutrient deficiency are likely to develop. In contrast, excessive intake can result in over-nutrition and obesity. Therefore, we have to eat the right amount of food to stay healthy.</h6>
